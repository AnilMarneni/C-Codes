Question 2:
Write a C++ program that takes a year from the user and print whether that year is a leap year or not..
Hint: A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with 00).
The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400.
Eg: 1999 is not a leap year  
    2000 is a leap year 
    2004 is a leap year
